# 365 Data Science Python Course 


I took this course with Martin Ganchev and Ned Krastev. Link: https://365datascience.com/courses/python-for-finance/

In this course, I worked on my programming skills in python as well as learnt about the financial theory, while working with real-world data from yahoo finance. 

Therefore, throughout the jupiter notebook, you will notice that I have typed out notes from the course regarding different financial theory. 

*This is not the complete course, I took advantage of their 30-days free trial to learn as much as I could*
